I am absolutely blown away at the extravagance of my Lord. The lavishness of His mercy and love toward all humanity is outrageous. From the very beginning of time we see He is a Father who extends His hand to His creation in fellowship and seeks to form a relationship with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-8fivq\">Genesis 3:8<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-625on\"><em>And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day&#8230;<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-a2k5k\"><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-8mvqc\">Genesis 3:9<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-59ujk\"><em>Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-fmqmc\">The Lord came to the garden. Adam and Eve did not come to Him. He came to them. He then called out to them to find out where they were. I don&#8217;t believe this was the first time He walked in the garden with them. I think He had done this before. He was expecting to see them. That is why He calls out to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\" id=\"viewer-6m6hb\"><p><em>How awesome that our God; our great King; would step down from His heavenly throne to walk with us and talk with us, to seek us out and call out our name.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-6f35r\">You know our God is so awesome that even after Adam and Eve sinned He put His divine plan into action to purchase us back from the hands of the enemy. He didn&#8217;t put a 12 step plan into place by which we could save ourselves and find a way to enlightenment or a higher spiritual plane. No! Our marvelous Father did it all. He made a way where there was no way, He straightened the crooked paths and set a rescue plan in place that would redeem the world back to Himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-k613\">In the very beginning we catch a glimpse of the plan to come:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-eu1ms\">Genesis 3:15<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-83bp3\"><em>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9fb8e\">God&#8217;s plan of redemption is perfect. Perfect in its execution, perfect in its design. The perfect King of Glory would do it all, for all who would believe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-fo75v\">Throughout the old testament we are shown the penalty of our sinful nature. The cost of sin upon our world. Countless animals were sacrificed to pay atonement for the sins of the people. The blood of the animals could not take away the sins of the people though, they only covered the sins for one year. This too was a foreshadow of what was to come. A picture of the sacrificial Lamb; the Lord Jesus who would come to earth as a perfect human, fully man. His perfection became the key to our salvation. He would walk in human flesh to be the one and only sacrifice for the entire world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9kk3n\">Isaiah 53 foretells the coming Messiah &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-75mb5\">Isaiah 53:4-6<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-egetf\"><em>Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned, every one, to his own way, and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-8d4n4\">The Bible says He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him &#8211; John 1:11. He came knowing He would be rejected; knowing many of His beloved children would turn their backs on Him. He chose to come. He chose to see the redemption plan through to completion. The love He had for His children drove Him to the cross; drove Him to lay down His life that we might live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-aa9ee\"><em>John 1:11<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-5g9qv\"><em>He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name; who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-df7h8\">The cross of Calvary is where our rescue plan came to completion. That cruel cruel cross, where our Saviour was stretched out as a curse for us, that our curse would be lifted. He was covered in blood and tears; his heart aching from separation from His Father. His body racked with excruciating pain. All for us. All part of His perfect plan. He took upon Himself the sins of all the world. All the evil that was due us and all the punishment that was due us was placed upon His shoulders and laid upon His body. He paid the price for my sin and your sin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-do928\">What a Saviour!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-728eg\"><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-98nv6\"><em>Beautiful Jesus!<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-bricf\">What a beautiful Saviour He is. He not only came up with the rescue plan, but He followed through with the rescue plan to bring us back in to a right relationship with our Father in heaven. He has given us everything pertaining to life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3) and blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3). All this He has done for us, that we might live the life He died for us to have. All this He did for us that we would love Him and adore Him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-455pr\">All He asks is that we believe. Believe in Him; believe in what He has done for us; believe that His word speaks truth and life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-7i2re\">Do you know my Saviour? The One who laid everything down for you.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-fmuc1\"><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-cg8c5\">Do you hear Him calling your name?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-4uc9g\">Will you bend your knees and thank Him for all He has done and invite Him into your life?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-4l535\"><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-br7ds\">Will you start your life anew, full of life and love; forgiven and redeemed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-dql0q\"><em>Will you choose this day to believe He is who He says He is?<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-61a01\">Will you believe He did it all for you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-ac8qo\">He is never far from you and His heart&#8217;s desire is that you find Him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-emd2i\"><em>Acts 17:26-27<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-5ajfp\"><em>And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their pre-appointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each of of us;&#8221;<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-ck49t\">May you experience the extravagant love of God in a new way today. May you see Him with new eyes.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-201sg\"><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/www.fathersloveletter.com\/\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you ever take time to just sit and think about God?
