Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! Your workmanship is marvellous \u2013 how well I know it. You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the dark of the womb. You saw me before I was born. Every day of my life was recorded in Your book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed. How precious are Your thoughts about me, O God. They cannot be numbered! I can\u2019t even count them. They outnumber the grains of sand. And when I wake up You are still with me! Ephesians 2:8-10 God saved you by His grace when you believed. And you can\u2019t take credit for this; it is a figt from God. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. For we are God\u2019s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-7ak5b\"><strong>I AM BLESSED AND HAVE ALL I NEED IN CHRIST.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-csp5r\">Colossians 2:9 For in Christ lives all the fullness of God in human body. <strong>I AM CHOSEN BY GOD<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-5t0cu\">1 Peter 2:9 But you are not like that, for you are a chosen people. You are royal priests, a holy nation, God\u2019s very own possession. As a result you can show others the goodness of God, for He called you out of the darkness into His wonderful light. Colossians 3:12 Since God chose you to be the holy people He loves, you must clothe yourselves with tender hearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. John 15:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-8bmac\">I no longer call you slaves, because a master doesn\u2019t confide in His slaves. Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me. You didn\u2019t chose me, I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for using My name. 1 Thessalonians 1:4 We know, dear brothers and sisters, that God loves you and has chosen you to be His own people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-du532\"><strong>I AM HOLY AND BLAMELESS IN HIS SIGHT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-7kc4t\">Romans 3:21-23 We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are, for everyone has sinned, we all fall short of God\u2019s glorious standard. 1 Corinthians 1:30 God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made Him to be wisdom itself. Christ made us right with God, He made us pure and holy and He freed us from sin. Ephesians 4:22-24 Throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. Put on your new nature, created to be like God, truly righteous and holy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-c1buv\"><strong>I AM A LOVED DAUGHTER\/SON OF GOD<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-v3ei\">Romans 8:15-17 So you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received God\u2019s spirit when He adopted you as His own children. Now we call Him Abba Father, for His spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God\u2019s heirs. In fact together with Christ we are heirs of God\u2019s glory. But if we are to share His glory, we must also share His suffering. 1 John 3:1 See how very much our Father loves us, for He calls us His children, and that is what we are! But the people who belong to this world don\u2019t recognise that we are God\u2019s children because they don\u2019t know Him. 1 John 4:9-10 God showed how much He loved us by sending His one and only Son into the world so that we might have eternal life through Him. This is real love \u2013 not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins. <strong>I AM A TROPHY OF THE GRACE OF GOD<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-8atnl\">Ephesians 2:4 But God is so rich in mercy, and He loved us so much, that even though we were dead because of our Sins, He gave us life when He raised Christ from the dead. 1 Corinthians 15:1-11 By the grace of God, I am what I am. By His stripes I am healed. I may still have scars but the wound is healed. Why did Jesus choose to keep the scars? The scars were the story of the victory He had won.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-36tlk\"><strong>I AM REDEEMED AND FORGIVEN<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-ac38m\">Isaiah 53 Who has believed our message? To whom has the Lord revealed his powerful arm? My servant grew up in the Lord\u2019s presence like a tender green shoot, like a root in dry ground. There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance, nothing to attract us to him. He was despised and rejected\u2014a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief. We turned our backs on him and looked the other way. He was despised, and we did not care. Yet it was our weaknesses he carried; it was our sorrows that weighed him down. And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God, a punishment for his own sins! But he was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins. He was beaten so we could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed. All of us, like sheep, have strayed away. We have left God\u2019s paths to follow our own. Yet the Lord laid on him the sins of us all. He was oppressed and treated harshly, yet he never said a word. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter. And as a sheep is silent before the shearers, he did not open his mouth. Unjustly condemned, he was led away. No one cared that he died without descendants, that his life was cut short in midstream. But he was struck down for the rebellion of my people. He had done no wrong and had never deceived anyone. But he was buried like a criminal; he was put in a rich man\u2019s grave. But it was the Lord\u2019s good plan to crush him and cause him grief. Yet when his life is made an offering for sin, he will have many descendants. He will enjoy a long life, and the Lord\u2019s good plan will prosper in his hands. When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish, he will be satisfied. And because of his experience, my righteous servant will make it possible for many to be counted righteous, for he will bear all their sins. I will give him the honours of a victorious soldier, because he exposed himself to death. He was counted among the rebels. He bore the sins of many and interceded for rebels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-coee5\">Colossians 1:10-14<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-cqmbr\">Then the way you live will always honour and please the Lord, and your lives will produce every kind of good fruit. All the while you will grow as you learn to know God better and better. We also pray that you will be strengthened with all His glorious power so you will have all the endurance and patience you need. May you be filled with joy, always thanking the Father. He has enabled you to share in the inheritance that belongs to His people, who live in the light. For He has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of His dear Son, who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins. <strong>I AM DEFENDED<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-c5u4d\">Exodus 14:14<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-b8s2c\">The Lord will fight for you; and you shall hold your peace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1sk3u\">Nehemiah 4:20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-dsi5o\">Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there.Our God will fight for us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-cjrtd\">Joshua 23:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-frv23\">One man of you shall chase a thousand, for the Lord your God is He who fights for you, as He promised you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a study I found on my shelf from way back!
