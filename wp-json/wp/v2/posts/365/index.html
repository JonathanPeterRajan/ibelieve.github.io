I currently work for the NHS in a Covid Hub in Grampian. I started there in April 2020 at the beginning of our lockdown. Over the last 9 months we have experienced great highs and great lows. Unfortunately the fight is not over yet and tragically we are seeing tougher days now than ever before. I am blessed to have been a part of such a fantastic team at the Covid Hub and to witness the commitment and compassion of our fantastic NHS staff and the lengths they go to for patient care. I am super proud of you all and all you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9aj12\">I have felt the Lord nudge me for some time now to write a blog. I started a few times but never really had the words to say. In August 2020 I was blessed with a best friend; Arun Geet Mohan from india. We pray and study God&#8217;s word every day. He has inspired me, encouraged me, prayed for me and challenged me over the last four months. Growing with the Lord has given me the confidence to try this venture and hope that He steps in and fills the pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-ac0dt\">So I am going to try and share my journey of faith with you. Share what I&#8217;m learning and hopefully help to encourage you and give you hope; leading to faith and belief. I believe that the greatest gift we can give to the Lord is faith and belief.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-8m8no\">The Bible says in Hebrews 11:6<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/1bad17_99f58104f7fc485a835fbffb305a5f9b~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fit\/w_750,h_1000,al_c,q_20\/file.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"524\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-clghj\">&#8220;And without faith it is impossible to please God. <em>Anyone who wants to come to Him must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek Him.<\/em>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-64mem\">The Lord wants to be found. He doesn&#8217;t want to be hidden from you. He wants you to search Him out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9g8ee\">Jeremiah the old testament prophet said in chapter 29:13<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-6s4l8\">&#8220;<em>You will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.<\/em>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-d01el\">I will not have all the answers, but my hope for this blog is to ignite faith, belief, passion and desire within you, that you would start to seek Him with all your heart and find your treasure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I thought it appropriate to give a brief introduction as to who I am and what this blog is all about.
