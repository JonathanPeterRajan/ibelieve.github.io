Some cause great destruction and seek to consume our whole lives while others are more subtle and can often operate beneath our level of consciousness and go un-recognised for some time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-4u75u\">Over the last 30 years, journeying with the Lord, He has taught me not to fight giants in my own strength, no matter what type they might be. The Lord has taught me that the only way to fight giants is with the word of God.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-e2er4\"><em>For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-e9rq5\"><em>Hebrews 4:12<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-apsu0\">The word of God is living and powerful, changing and transforming everyone who hears it. It is our sword, our weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-653f3\"><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-3e51d\"><em>Ephesians 6:17<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-9tahu\"><em>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\" id=\"viewer-2olvd\"><p>If God has given us such a powerful weapon, then why do we not use it to fight the giants?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-dba5m\">About 6 years ago I found myself in the most terrifying place I have ever been. I had attended my Church prayer meeting that evening and as I knelt in prayer beside my bed later that night I asked the Lord this question &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\" id=\"viewer-402ks\"><p>&#8220;Am I afraid to die?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-7b43v\">Instantly, I was hit with a great wave of fear, almost like a tsunami that consumed me in wave after wave of emotion. I was in the grips of something terrifying and I didn&#8217;t know what to do. I was so scared I couldn&#8217;t even cry out to God. All I could do was bury my head in my pillow and close my eyes to what was going on. By God&#8217;s grace I was able to sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9em8\">When I awoke the next day fear hit me all over again like a tsunami that never seemed to stop coming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-b2a7h\">For the next couple of weeks I couldn&#8217;t eat, I couldn&#8217;t read my Bible, I couldn&#8217;t pray, I couldn&#8217;t watch TV or hold a conversation. I couldn&#8217;t do anything without being twisted with fear from the inside out. When I went to work all I could say was &#8220;Help me Jesus&#8221; over and over. My whole body shook with fear all day long, so much so that I was constantly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. Amazingly the Lord gave me strength to get through each day and at night He brought peace to me so that I was able to sleep and escape the fear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-63ibb\">Everything at this point scared me. Even the mention of God terrified me. There was no escape in my waking hours from the torment of fear. Then, one day&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\" id=\"viewer-f3b3t\"><p><em>I turned to scriptures for comfort and help.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-knf9\">I opened my Bible at 1 John 4:18-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-17kj6\"><em>There is no fear in love;<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-6fu38\"><em>but perfect love casts out fear,<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-ist\"><em>because fear involves torment.<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-6gdiq\"><em>But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\" id=\"viewer-9pbki\"><p>This verse jumped out at me.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\" id=\"viewer-9nt7o\"><p>Perfect love casts out ALL fear.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1p9v4\">So, I thought to myself &#8220;What is perfect love?&#8221; Surely, I thought, the love of Jesus is perfect love. He has perfected His love for me through His finished work on the cross. And His Holy Spirit lives inside of me, meaning that the perfect love of Jesus abides in His Holy Spirit who abides in me. If the Holy Spirit abides in me then perfect love abides in me and where perfect love is there is no fear. All I had to do was believe it and declare it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-6ob9k\">So, for days I would repeat again and again &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\" id=\"viewer-879t1\"><p><em>&#8220;Perfect love casts out all fear. My Saviour Jesus is perfect love and He lives inside of me through His Spirit, filling me with His perfect love. Where His perfect love is all fear is cast out.&#8221;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-b05fr\">I spoke this over myself again and again. Sometimes repeating it dozens of times in a day. The fear didn&#8217;t go away instantly but it did subside as the days went on. I just kept declaring this passage of scripture over myself repeatedly. Over time I realised I was saying this verse less and less and the chaos inside of me was growing calmer and calmer. The peace that surpasses all understanding grew stronger and stronger upon my life. My appetite returned, the anxiety and fear left, the shaking and dizzy spells stopped and before long my peace had returned completely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-98bmg\">When we fight using God&#8217;s weapons the giants that once paralysed us become like ants in our hands. All it takes is simple faith. All we need to do is take a verse, believe what is says and declare it over our lives. As we declare the truth of God&#8217;s word, the word, which is living and powerful, delivers us from the lie that binds us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1ngj0\">In the song &#8220;The Voice of Truth&#8221; by Casting Crowns the chorus says<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-88bop\">&#8220;But the voice of truth tells me a different story The voice of truth says, &#8220;Do not be afraid!&#8221; The voice of truth says, &#8220;This is for My glory&#8221; Out of all the voices calling out to me I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-2u7np\">You see no matter what giant is coming at you today you have a choice whether to believe the voice of the enemy or the voice of truth. Whether it is coming after your health, your marriage, your family, your finances, or your faith, the truth of the word tells us we have a Saviour that has won against every giant and He has overcome everything that would come against us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-bdu9s\"><em>John 16:33<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-eugfg\"><em>These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer, <u>I have overcome the world.<\/u><\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-882hn\">Be of good cheer, Jesus has overcome the world and everything in it. His promises are for us to declare over our lives. He has given us His word, His manual for every situation that would come our way. It frees us from the things that ensnare us and seek to destroy our connection with God.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-2nst5\">We serve a perfect Father and His loving kindness is like no other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\" id=\"viewer-1kb5r\"><p><em>If we would only believe God&#8217;s words more than we believe the words of the enemy our lives would be so different!<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"viewer-8255f\"><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-5is2b\">A few promise verses to get you started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9mko7\"><strong>Nahum 1:7<\/strong> The Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble.

Find the verse that best suits your situation or circumstance and pray it over yourself regularly, out loud for all to hear. Make it your own and believe what is says.
