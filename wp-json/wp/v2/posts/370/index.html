A battle of the mind to actually write something on this blog. My mind has been full of words. Words that made sense in my mind but once I typed them on the page they made no sense at all. Each time I would sit to type I would hear words like &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-7pu8l\">&#8220;Who do you think you are?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-bvc40\">and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-7vd6g\">&#8220;You can&#8217;t do this, you don&#8217;t have the wisdom for something like this.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-c17rk\">Words, words, words. Words that can destroy your confidence and steal your calling; rob your peace and kill your destiny.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-72n17\">Jesus tells us in John 10:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-3v16s\"><em>&#8220;The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.&#8221;<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-65ibf\">The thief only comes to steal what God has placed within us which is the hope of glory; to kill our faith in a loving Father; and to destroy our belief in God&#8217;s ability to transform us into the likeness of Jesus. If we listen to these words and allow them to settle in our hearts and minds then the thief has won. He gets the victory and we fall in defeat to fear, guilt, shame and regret.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-17gde\">However, the second part of John 10:10 says<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-6u15t\"><em>&#8220;Jesus came that we may have life, and that we may have it more abundantly.&#8221;<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-c59c1\">Hallelujah that our Lord Jesus came and died that we might live. He took all our shame, guilt, fear, and regret. He suffered a cruel death to pay for our sins. By His death we have life. We can live an abundant life because of what He did for us. His words for us are full of life and truth. Words of love and sacrifice. Words of power and authority. They are not empty words and empty promises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-4l27u\">Simon Peter said to Jesus in John 6:68 &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-5ce7s\"><em>&#8220;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.&#8221;<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-crub6\">We have a Saviour who knows everything that we go through, every giant that we face. He knows the struggles and battles we have endured and are still enduring. He doesn&#8217;t want us to fail; to fall to the enemy. He wants to equip us and arm us with words of power; words of life; words of transformation; words of hope. To equip us He gave us a manual for life; the word of God.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-20me9\">Some time back I wrote in my Bible these words:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/1bad17_b9d8a4b58d72427cb884ef74411daafc~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fit\/w_750,h_1000,al_c,q_20\/file.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-50kkq\">THIS IS MY MANUAL FOR LIFE! DO NOT FORGET TO READ IT AND FOLLOW IT&#8217;S INSTRUCTIONS! YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9ohad\">2 Timothy 3:16-17 also tells us &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-4kji\"><em>&#8220;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.&#8221;<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-a96fs\">Our amazing Father, Saviour, and best friend has done everything possible for us to draw near to Him and experience His love and care for us. The Bible has an answer for all your questions and all your problems. For the Bible is the living word of God, inspired by God Himself. Try reading it for yourself today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-2fsu6\">Here is a couple of scriptures to help you get started with claiming back your stolen hope; for resurrecting your faith and rebuilding your relationship of trust with the Father to see transformation in your life; and to see you grow and mature in Him and all that He has called you to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-a2s7j\">James 4:7<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-anl3a\"><em>&#8220;Therefore, submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.&#8221;<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-dta6e\">Revelation 12:11<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-6rd25\"><em>&#8220;Overcome him [the enemy] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of your testimony and do not love your life to the death.&#8221;<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9f3qe\">The enemy&#8217;s greatest fear is that we would awaken to the truth of who we really are. For each one of us is on the planet right now for such a time as this. Each one of us has a divine purpose and plan for our lives. Each one of us is precious in God&#8217;s eyes. He calls us by name. Yes He knows your name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-ad5b2\">Isaiah 43:1<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-be4ed\">&#8220;But now, thus says the Lord, who created you, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel, &#8220;Fear not, for I have redeemed you, I have called you by your name;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-ei2pr\">You are Mine.&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-cl0d9\">He calls to you today to come to Him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-bbdf7\">Thank you for reading my first official blog post.
